# Standard Exceptions Package

This project is aimed at providing additional standard exceptions to [PHP](http://www.php.net/). 

Many exceptions that are missing from the SPL are constantly being reproduced in different projects. By providing a package of high-quality, well organised exceptions, it will, in the long run, increase interoperability between projects and libraries.
