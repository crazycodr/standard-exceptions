/**
 * Use this exception when the data requested by your code cannot be found. In most scenarios, this is the equivalent
 * of an item that cannot be found in a filesystem or in a database. The big difference is that this item is not
 * linked to a specific context such as the filesystem nor is it linked to the HTTP context.
 *
 * If the code in context is a service provider that queries a database, this would be the right exception to throw
 * and listen for. The controller on the other hand would catch this and throw a NotFoundException from the Http
 * namespace which would be converted to a standardized message in the front controller.
